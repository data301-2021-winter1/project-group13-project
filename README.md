The 2021 Stack Overflow developer survey contains responses of 83439 software developers from 181 countries around the world. The survey aims to "improve the Stack Overflow community and the platform that serves them." This year's survey was fielded from May 25, 2021 to June 25, 2021. Due to the 2020 annual survey's failure to capture the Covid 19 pandemic hit, the 2021 annual survey aims to "see how codersâ€™ lives have changed during this massive work-from-home experiment." While there were new questions regarding working asynchronously and remote communications, the survey still featured many old classical questions, such as the most popular programming language. The 2021 survey also collects each developers' demographics, educational background, coding experiences and developer roles. Other work-related data such as employment status, company info and salary are also collected. While being the largest and the most comprehensive developer survey, the respondents are recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow and are not 100% representative of the population.
